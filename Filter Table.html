The barndoor skate is one of the largest skates in the world. Skates are closely related to the rays. The skates are the most diverse lineage of the cartilaginous fishes . The term ‘cartilaginous fishes’ refers to the fact that these groups do not have true bone and instead have skeletons made of hardened cartilage. barndoor skates grow to lengths of at least 5 feet (1.5 m) and weights up to 44 pounds (20 kg). Historically, they were commercially valuable.</p></td>

Saltwater crocodiles of this size are capable of eating just about any animal that strays too close and are particularly adept at drowning terrestrial creatures like birds and mammals. Named for its ability to survive in full salinity seawater, saltwater crocodiles typically live in brackish (low salinity) water near the coast.</p></td>

The nurse shark is one of the most commonly observed sharks on coral and rocky reefs of the eastern Pacific Ocean and the eastern and western Atlantic Ocean. Given that nurse sharks give live birth and that individuals (even juveniles) have relatively small home ranges, it is surprising that all individuals across this large, tropical to warm temperate distribution are the same species. An extensive genetic study of the nurse shark may reveal the existence of different species in different ocean basins (e.g., on either side of Central America).</p></td>
